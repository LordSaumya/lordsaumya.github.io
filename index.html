    <h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>

    <p>I am always excited to explore new fields. I am broadly interested and have worked in the following areas:
    </p>

    <h3 id="swdev">Software Development</h3>

    <p>The intersection of scientific computing and machine learning is my favorite place to work in. I believe that
        machine learning techniques are a necessity for current and future data intensive experiments. ML techniques
        can
        also serve as surrogates for computationally expensive simulations. On the other hand, insights from physics
        could be helpful for interpretability and uncertainty quantification of ML models.</p>

    <h3 id="cosmology">Cosmology</h3>

    <p>I worked at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) under Dr. Michael Schneider during 2017-2019. Here
        is a
        overview of my projects:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>I joined LLNL as a fellow in their Data Science Summer Institute (DSSI). I worked with Dr. Michael
                Schneider on a Hierarchical Bayesian Model to solve the inverse problem of inferring cosmic shear
                and
                intrinsic galaxy properties from data that will be collected by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
                (LSST). I used Probabilistic Graphical Models and wrote MCMC algorithms (Metropolis Hastings within
                Gibbs) to infer the posterior distribution of cosmic shear and intrinsic ellipticity (shape) from
                observed galaxies in the weak lensing regime. I am now working on an extended hierarchical model
                incorporating non-shape galaxy properties like flux, Sersic profile and half light radius along with
                ellipticity. Our end goal is to determine the multivariate population statistics, including
                correlations
                amongst different properties of all four billion galaxies in LSST. I gave a talk on this project in
                the
                Bay Area LSST &amp; Machine Learning Meeting at UC Berkeley in December 2018.<br />

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Gaussian process for cosmological parameter estimation: It has been shown that certain gaussian
                process
                kernels are equivalent to infinitely wide deep neural networks while also providing robust
                uncertainty
                quantification. Under Dr. Schneider, I am also exploring the use of neural network equivalent
                Gaussian
                Processes (NNGPs) to estimate cosmological parameters (such as ratio of baryonic matter to dark
                matter)
                from observed 3D mass maps of galactic surveys. I am currently testing my pipeline on simulated toy
                models. The main challenges I face here are efficient representation of 3D volumes and improving
                Gaussian Process scalability.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>I also briefly worked in the Gravity group at Georgia Tech, on Gaussian Processes as surrogates for expensive
        gravitational wave simulations.</p>

    <p>During my undergrad, I worked in Otte group at GT on simulation code for large scale cosmic ray showers. I
        added
        functionality for creating new telescope models in GrOptics (specifically included Schwarzschild-Couder
        model
        for Chernekov Telescope Array). I also wrote scripts to run large scale HPC simulations.
        I received my first President's Undergraduate Research Award (PURA) for this work.<br />
        <a href="https://github.com/groptics/groptics">GitHub Project Link</a> (I created the GrOptics GitHub
        account
        and repo)
    </p>

    <p>Really old: Here is a freshman year report that I am proud of. I observed the location of sunsets throughout
        the
        semester and explained the trends.<br />

    <h3 id="computational-chemistry">Computational Chemistry</h3>

    <p>I worked with Professor Andrew Medford on deep learning approaches to density functional theory from
        2017-2019.
        For my undergraduate thesis, I focused on the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in finding a
        unique
        mapping between the electron density and the exchange-correlation potential of a system. My current project
        is
        uncertainty quantification for machine learned surrogate functionals. I used bootstrap aggregation with an
        ensemble of weak learners (shallow neural nets) to perform uncertainty quantification. Concurrently, I am
        building a data management framework to make all stages of the machine learning workflow smoother on the
        Georgia
        Tech HPC clusters. I received my second President's Undergraduate Research Award (PURA) from Georgia Tech
        for
        this work in Fall 2017.<br />
        <a href="https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/61364">Undergraduate Thesis</a>
    </p>

    <p>For my <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~echow/cse8803asc-20.html">Advanced Scientific Computing class</a>,
        I
        worked on using neural network equivalent Gaussian Processes to solve the Schrödinger equation. I used it to
        solve the ground state energy for 2D electron systems. It works well with robust uncertainty quantification,
        but
        suffers from the scalability issues inherent to Gaussian Processes.<br />

    <h3 id="ai-interpretability-societal-impact">AI Interpretability &amp; Societal Impact</h3>

    <p>Complimentary to my SciML projects, I am also interested in interpretable machine learning. I feel that the
        black
        box nature of current deep models is not ideal for scientific discovery. I am looking into robust
        uncertainty
        quantification, Bayesian methods, etc. </p>

    <p>Along with collaborators from Texas A&amp;M University, I recently submitted a paper to <strong>NeurIPS
            2020</strong>, on the difference in Fourier spectrum of real and generated images. We demonstrated a low
        (computational) cost technique to detect synthetic images, which could also be used to interpret GANs and
        VAEs.<br />
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.06465">arXiv:1911.06465</a>
    </p>

    <p>In order to better understand the societal impacts of AI, I am filling the social science gaps in my
        knowledge. I
        am currently enrolled in the excellent <a href="https://micromasters.mit.edu/dedp/">MIT Micromasters in
            Data,
            Economics and Developmental Policy program</a>. I am learning about the design of social experiments,
        which
        are sometimes trickier than the computational science experiments I am used to.</p>

    <p>Previously, as a member of the Data Driven Education team, I worked on statistical methods to tailor GT’s
        pioneering online courses to student performance. In my senior year, I led a team of junior undergrads and
        we
        presented one such scheme at the Georgia Tech STEM Education Research Expo.<br />

    <h2 id="selected-academic-projects">Selected Academic Projects</h2>

    <p>I have been fascinated with cellular automata ever since I encountered Conway’s game of life in freshman
        year.
        This lead to adventures in non-linear dynamics (chaos theory). </p>

    <h4 id="neural-cellular-automata">Neural Cellular Automata</h4>

    <p>Currently, I am intrigued by <a href="https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/">neural cellular automata</a>. I
        have
        been playing around with it while under lockdown. I will post about my experiments soon.</p>

    <h4 id="emergent-phenomena">Emergent Phenomena</h4>

    <p>I took a great course on emergent phenomena with <a href="https://people.clarkson.edu/~lschulma/">Prof. L. S.
            Schulman</a> in Spring 2020. The class consisted of four students and the professor. I learnt about the
        relevance of statistical mechanics in a wide variety of fields (from finance to syncing fireflies). I gave a
        presentation of the emergence of Zipf’s law from simple assumptions about human settlements.<br />
        You can find the presentation here: <a href="/res/GROW_presentation.pdf">Cities and Galaxies</a> Note: It
        ends
        with <em>aliens</em>.</p>

    <h4 id="reservoir-computing">Reservoir Computing</h4>

    <p>I worked on “predicting” chaotic systems as a project in my <a
            href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2019/cs7643_fall/">deep learning class</a>. Inspired by <a
            href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/machine-learnings-amazing-ability-to-predict-chaos-20180418/">this
            article</a> and the linked papers, I explored the use of reservoir computing for predicting time series.
        It
        worked excellently for repeating series, but also worked eerily well for chaotic systems.<br />

        preliminary results some day, sigh)</p>

    <h4 id="wolfram-summer-school">Wolfram Summer School</h4>

    <p>I was fortunate to be accepted into Wolfram Summer School 2016. It was an intense experience with some of the
        brightest people I have met. I worked on automatic classification of cellular automata, under Dr. Georgia
        Fortuna, with some advice from Stephen Wolfram. I got inducted in the cult of Mathematica (feels so good
        when
        you solve a complicated problem with a paragraph long one liner, which feels great when you write it, but
        takes
        20 minutes to decipher when you read it two years later) and functional programming.<br />

    <h4 id="migration-modeling">Migration Modeling</h4>

    <p>I combined cellular automata (Schelling's Segregation Model) and n-body simulation (Barnes-hut algorithm) to
        model population movement, taking into account multiple factors such as wealth, race etc.<br />

    <h4 id="chuas-circuit">Chua's Circuit</h4>

    <p>For my electronics class, I made Chua’s circuit. It exhibits chaotic behavior. Looking at phase plots on a
        three
        decade old oscillator (because newer digital ones can't handle that) was the highlight of my course. I also
        wrote a small matlab simulator.<br />
        Here’s a short report:

        plots)

    <h4 id="cellular-automata-simulator">Cellular Automata Simulator</h4>

    <p>I wrote a cellular automata simulator in Java for my computational physics class, complete with an Arduino
        implementation on rings and grids of LEDs.<br />

    <h2 id="tools-i-use">Tools I Use</h2>

    <p>In decreasing order of proficiency:</p>

    <p><strong>Python</strong>: Bread and butter. I use the “data-science stack” (numpy, scipy et al) everyday. I
        alternate between TF and PyTorch depending on the project. I experiment with code in Jupyter notebooks and
        convert finished code into modules (sometimes). I am very comfortable with python, but need to learn better
        testing and documentation practices.</p>

    <p><strong>Mathematica</strong>: I use it for hairy math problems. I also use it because it is always satisfying
        to
        get non trivial things done with a few function calls. </p>

    <p><strong>Matlab</strong>: Mostly use it for coursework that requires matlab.</p>

    <p><strong>Julia</strong>: More out of intellectual curiosity. It has an active scientific computing community
        and
        claims to combine the ease of python with the performance of C.</p>

    <p><strong>C, C++</strong>: Used it for GrOptics. Also for learning HPC (MPI) and my systems and networking
        classes.
        I can get things done after many Stack Overflow look ups.</p>

    <p><strong>Java</strong>: Language of choice when starting out my degree. Learn OOP on Java and C++. Can’t
        believe I
        wrote a GUI cellular automata simulator in it a long time ago. Won’t be able to do that today.</p>

    <p><strong>R</strong>: Trying it for my social science classes. It feels like a lower friction way to do
        statistics
        than python.</p>

    <p><strong>FORTRAN</strong>: Tried it for that one physics professor who won't use anything else. Don’t remember
        it
        at all now.</p>

    <h3 id="others">Others</h3>

    <p><strong>Shell Scripting</strong>: Writing good bash scripts is an under appreciated skill. These are helpful
        for
        managing multiple simulations and making sure ML pipelines work smoothly.</p>

    <p><strong><span class="latex">L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span></strong>: Documents look beautiful, once I
        figure out how to put that image below the paragraph I want.</p>

    <p><strong>Hardware</strong>: I am comfortable with basic electronics and soldering. I like tinkering with
        Arduino
        and Raspberry Pi boards. I recently setup a <a href="https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole">pi-hole</a> for my
        home
        network. I also built my own PC for deep learning and gaming, christened <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">ada</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Some HTML/CSS</strong>: Mostly to make personal websites, and to look for easter eggs on Mr. Robot
        and
        Westworld websites. Hugo and Jupyter and Markdown are easier for me. </p>

    <h2 id="service">Service</h2>

    <p>I believe that giving back is an important part of a career in science. As a lowly grad student, I try to
        volunteer wherever I can. Some of the highlights are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Volunteered at ICML 2020 (remote, IST)</li>
        <li>Volunteered at ICLR 2019, New Orleans</li>
        <li>Student travel award to WSSSPE 14 in Manchester</li>
        <li>Student travel award to JupyterCon.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I serve as a reviewer for President’s Undergraduate Research Award in the fields of physics and computer
        science.
    </p>

    <p>I was also elected Senator to the Graduate Student Senate from the School of Computational Science &amp;
        Engineering for 2018-2019 and 2019-2020.</p>

    <p>In my youth (6 years ago in 2014), I experimented with a start up, cryptomen.com (the website is dead, we had
        some articles about us though). It was five of us scattered throughout North America, and we traded crypto
        currencies back when bitcoin was about $400. We raised about $47000 from individual investors. I learnt a
        lot
        about crypto currencies, dealing with people, marketing and trading stresses.<br />
        <a href="http://cryptomen.com/about-cryptomen/">Dead domain</a>, <a
            href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptomen-launches-breakthrough-btc-investment-trading-service">an
            article about us</a>
    </p>

    <p>I also cofounded Georgia Tech's first Cryptocurrency club around that time. We invited people in Atlanta's
        cryptocurrency scene to give talks at GT, left 3D printed wallets with 0.0000001 BTC at random spots around
        campus and just spread awareness about cryptocurrencies in general.</p>

    <p>In high school, I made a Jarvis like voice automation system with a friend. This was 2010, before Siri and
        AWS
        and home automation were cool. The whole system was made out of junk parts. An ancient desktop with a
        parallel
        port was the brain. The parallel port pins were connected to relays which were driving the mains current to
        various appliances. We used the hilariously bad Windows speech recognition to manipulate some cmd scripts
        which
        turned the parallel pins on and off. As stupid teenagers, we had open mains lines on the floor. I am happy
        to be
        alive.<br />
